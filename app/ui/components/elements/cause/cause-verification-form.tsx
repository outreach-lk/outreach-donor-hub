                You may now submit your Donation Campaign (Cause) for 
                human verification, where a team of volunteering moderators will try to confirm the credibility 
                of the claims you have made and ensure nothing fishy gets through.<br/>
                This process might take upto couple of days depending on the availability of mods.<br/>
                We thank you for you patience. <br/><br/>

                We may contact you from time to time.
